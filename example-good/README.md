Navigate to the project directory:

cd calculator

Install dependencies (if any):
For this project, there are no external Python dependencies. However, if there were, you would install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This project only requires a standard Python 3 installation.

Usage Examples
To run the calculator:

Navigate to the src directory:

Run the calculator.py script:

python calculator.py

You will see a menu like this:

Welcome to the Simple Calculator!

Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit
Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5):

Follow the prompts to perform calculations. For example:

Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit
Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5): 4
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 0
Error: Cannot divide by zero!

Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract

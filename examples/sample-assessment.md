# Sample Assessment: ITEC203 Programming Fundamentals

## Assessment Title
ITEC203 Assessment Test 1: Report + Python Code

## Description
This assessment evaluates students' understanding of Python programming fundamentals, including variables, control structures, functions, and basic data structures. Students are required to submit both a written report explaining their approach and the actual Python code implementation.

## Marking Criteria

### Code Quality (40 points)
- **Correctness (20 points)**: Code runs without errors and produces expected output
- **Efficiency (10 points)**: Code uses appropriate algorithms and data structures
- **Readability (10 points)**: Code is well-commented, properly formatted, and follows Python conventions

### Problem Solving (30 points)
- **Algorithm Design (15 points)**: Logical approach to solving the problem
- **Implementation (15 points)**: Correct translation of algorithm to code

### Documentation (20 points)
- **Code Comments (10 points)**: Clear explanations of code logic
- **Report Quality (10 points)**: Well-written explanation of approach and methodology

### Testing (10 points)
- **Test Cases (5 points)**: Appropriate test cases included
- **Edge Cases (5 points)**: Handling of edge cases and error conditions

## Instructions for Students

1. **Problem Statement**: Create a Python program that processes a list of student grades and provides statistical analysis.

2. **Requirements**:
   - Read grades from a file or user input
   - Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation
   - Display results in a formatted table
   - Handle edge cases (empty list, invalid grades, etc.)
   - Include appropriate error handling

3. **Deliverables**:
   - Python source code (.py file)
   - Written report explaining your approach (PDF or DOCX)
   - Test cases demonstrating functionality

4. **Submission Format**:
   - Submit both files together
   - Ensure code is properly commented
   - Report should be 2-3 pages maximum

5. **Grading Focus**:
   - Code functionality and correctness
   - Quality of documentation and comments
   - Understanding demonstrated in the report
   - Handling of edge cases and errors
